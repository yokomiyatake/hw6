- Using Min-Max algorithm.
- Changed the program to get scores of the each situation
from the score table. I got it from here:

<!-- - Added __isLastPhase()__ to see if the game ends soon.
If the number of left spaces are less than 12, the program change 
the way of scoring from the score table method to greedy method. -->
