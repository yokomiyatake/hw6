# 6

### Strategy
- Using __Alpha-Beta pruning__ and expect next situations with __depth 6__
(it should be changed dinamically with the elapsed time, but now it is fixed).
- Scores of each situation are get from the score table.
I got it from here:

- â†’ Changed the score table to the one from here
(https://uguisu.skr.jp/othello/5-1.html)
and adjusted it by myself.

- The __score table is different__ slightly __between first and middle phase__.

- In __last phase__, the strategy changes 
from getting most scores to __getting most pieces__ 
because the program can estimate all of the possible situation.

- A parameter from __the number of valid moves for the next player__ is added to the score
before last phase.
